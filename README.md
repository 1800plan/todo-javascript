Basic to-do that uses Javascript, HTML and CSS

The Magnificently Basic ToDo (student assignment)

This todo let's you create a short to-do notes to a list. You can delete the note by clicking the 'X' symbol at the end of the note. This is basically a small variation of W3School's todo list example.

TODO's:
- more refined todo
- checklists
- dropdown menu
- html 5 drag and drop
- more javascript
